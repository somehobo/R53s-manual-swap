## Credits

* The actual swap on this project was daunting at first due to the lack of online resources, however, after starting it becomes more comfortable. I got a bunch of help from Way cooper at Way Motor Works. I also used a bunch of Mod Mini's youtube videos for guidance on certain things in this job.

* Also definitely take a look at realoem, its a massive help.

## The Actual Swap

* The gist of this job is to pull the motor to get the auto transmission off and route what you need to, then put the engine back in and code the modules.

* To remove the engine I followed Mod Mini's [engine removal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fie-sUtiNAo). Instead of unplugging the entire harness I followed his steps in the description to leave it attached, this will help you route the new harness with the engine off. For the Auto, there's three connections that you will need to remove as well as the shifter line to get the engine out. Also for the love of god don't use a 12 point socket for the header bolts, be better than us.

With the engine out there is a number of things to do

* Take off automatic transmission. I laid my engine on the ground with a crane supporting and cardboard underneath, then unbolted all the bellhousing bolts and it slid right off. the torque converter is held on by 6 bolts that can be accessed on the backside of the flywheel. Leaks a bunch of oil so have rags or a bucket ready. Then you can take off the old flywheel

* Install the new flywheel and clutch. I followed mod mini's [clutch replacement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH8KHy-rw_k&t=1055s). Then slide the new manual transmission into place on the engine and bolt up using the 9 bell housing bolts.

* Install pedals and route clutch hard lines. There should be a little nipple on the right side of your brake reservoir which you can cut to put the clutch feedline over. This was by far the most anger inducing part of this project because of the tight spaces. There's a plug to the right of the brake master cylinder that both the clutch feedline and clutch hardline route, the rubber nipple on clutch line 21526774286 fills this in. I found that its easiest to connect the two hard lines going to the pedals and feed it through the firewall without the L bracket on. Also the clutch feed line goes through the little hole on the back side of the pedal mount. good luck this part sucks.

* Install new shift lug. To get access to the bottom of the shifter, you will need to remove the heat shielding, just a bunch of 10 mm nuts hold it in place and it'll slide right out of the engine bay. Then you will see 4 torx screws holding it in place. The interior bit at the base of the shift boot pops right out, I ended up cutting the boot because I couldn't get the knob off. Make sure to unplug any connections you see. We ended up taking apart the center console to get access to the clips holding the shifter in, and with enough wrestling it should come loose. Then you can slide your new manual shift lug in place, which will also be held in by the same 4 screws. Then put back all of that heat shielding

* Install new oil filter housing with new filter. uses the same bolts as the old one except for one which is slightly longer

* Install harness on the engine while its off

* Install cooling hoses on the engine while its off. I didn't do it this way but looking back it will save a lot of hassle in tight spaces.

* Now you should be ready to put the engine back in, put it back in the way mod mini took it out and reconnect all of the coolant lines and electrical connections. I wouldn't button all the way back up, just to test if it works or not.

* Next hookup the last clutch line and the slave cylinder. I followed mod mini's [clutch bleeding video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoiXWFdSuDM&t=515s) then put tranny oil (can leak out of axle holes so put axles in first), oil, and coolant in.

* Now time for NCSexpert and NCSdummy stuff: [video to understand the basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aacf0CtAVz8). To recode your car for manual, what we did was read through each module using NCSexpert and NCSdummy looking for options that relate to the manual transmission, you will definitely notice them by name (ones asking what transmission is in it). Make sure to take out the option for the safe start clutch signal if you don't have a clutch sensor. Then you can export any modules you mess with. Make sure to hookup a battery charger so you don't lose connection with the DME and brick your car. Once that's done you should be clear to start it!

* Now you can button all the way back up and take it for a test drive!

* Still working on trying to get the reverse lights to work, I think it might have to do with the circular harness on the driver side of the car.
